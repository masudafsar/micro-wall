This project developed and designed by [Masud Afsar](https://github.com/masudafsar) base on the given assignment by Formaloo team.



### How to run the project

We can run the project on `development` or `production` mode. First you need to install the dependencies with command below:

```sh
npm install
```

Then with this command we can start the project in `development` mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

After running development server open it in your browser [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

And for run the project in `production` mode you need to `build` it first and after that use `preview` script to run a server:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

The production web server runs on port 3000, so you can see it in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
